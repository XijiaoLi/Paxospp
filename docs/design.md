## Overview
 Team Paxospp aims to create a lightweight Paxos consensus protocol library that has a simple and easy-to-use interface. This libaray helps the programmers to develop multi-server applications without dealing with all the system, networks, and other reliability issues.  

### Agreement in a Distributed System
    Consensus in the Distributed Systems
    - Majority agreement
    - Network issues
    - Node issues

### Communication between the servers
    gRPC
    - http2 over TCP
    - Less TCP connections overall, less RTTs

## Design Choices

### Multithreading in the Paxos logs, a long-live listening server thread
### Smart pointers
### Multi-level locks 


## Features

### Lightweight
### Easy to use
### Fast and fault tolorance

## Future works
### Enable Polymorphism Storage
